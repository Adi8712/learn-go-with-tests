<p align="center" style="font-size: 50"> <em> The test speaks to us more clearly, as if it were an assertion of truth, <b>not a sequence of operations</b></em> </p>

## Philosophy

```
Write a test

Make the compiler pass

Run test -> see it fails -> check error message is meaningful

Write enough code to make the test pass

Refactor

Write better documentation to understand its usage quickly
```

## OOP

-   Function Overloading &rarr; Compilation Error `Function redeclared in block`
    -   declare functions in different packages
    -   define methods
