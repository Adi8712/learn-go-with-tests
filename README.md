<p style="text-align:center; font-size: larger; font-weight: bold"> The test speaks to us more clearly, as if it were an assertion of truth, not a sequence of operations </p>

## Philosophy
```
Write a test

Make the compiler pass

Run test -> see it fails -> check error message is meaningful

Write enough code to make the test pass

Refactor

Write better documentation to understand its usage quickly
```

## OOP

_Yes and No_

    -   Struct can be a functional equivalent
-   Function Overloading &rarr; Compilation Error `Function redeclared in block`
    -   declare functions in different packages
    -   define methods
-
